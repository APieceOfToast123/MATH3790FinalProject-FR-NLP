# WKU MATH 3790 Final Project: Machine Learning Applications in Classical Poem Generation and Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition

This repository contains the code and resources for two advanced machine learning projects: classical Chinese poem generation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and real-time facial expression recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Chinese Poem Generator: Utilizes a Transformer-based model trained on a diverse dataset of classical Chinese poems. Despite challenges with data complexity and limited dataset size, the project explores techniques for improving text coherence and stylistic accuracy.

Facial Expression Recognition: Implements a custom CNN trained on the FER-2013 dataset for detecting emotions in real-time. The system is designed to handle variability in real-world conditions, with future enhancements aimed at improving accuracy and robustness.

This repository includes detailed code implementations, data preprocessing steps, model training processes, and evaluation metrics for both projects. Contributions and suggestions for further improvements are welcome.
